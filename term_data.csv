AJAX,Asynchronous Javascript And XML,"Ajax( Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a set of web development techniques that use many web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can asynchronously send and retrieve data from a server without interfering with the existing page’s display and behavior. Ajax is not a programming language, and it requires a built-in browser with the XMLHttpRequest object that requests data from the server. It also uses JavaScript and HTML DOM to display the data. Ajax is widely used in client-side programming (e.g., JavaScript) to allow for data to be sent and received to and from a database/server. The data in the background can be easily exchanged without compromising the user experience.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/AJAX
API,Application Programming Interface,"An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface. The API can be seen as a simple contract (the interface) between the application offering it and other items, such as third party software or hardware. In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. methods, properties, events, and URLs) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, or other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third party websites and services.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API
ARIA,Accessible Rich Internet Applications,"Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. It supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible navigation landmarks in HTML4, JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ARIA
AWS,Amazon Web Services,"Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services
BASH,Bourne Again SHell,"Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. A version is also available for Windows 10 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)
CDN,Content Delivery Network,"A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a group of servers spread out over many locations. These servers store duplicate copies of data so that servers can fulfill data requests based on which servers are closest to the respective end-users. CDNs make for fast service less affected by high traffic.

CDNs are used widely for delivering stylesheets and Javascript files (static assets) of libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery etc.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CDN
CLI,Command Line Interface,"CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

In the 1960s, using only computer terminals, this was the only way to interact with computers.

In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS.

Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).

However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface
CLR,Common Language Runtime,"The common language runtime makes it easy to design components and applications whose objects interact across languages. Objects written in different languages can communicate with each other, and their behaviors can be tightly integrated. For example, you can define a class and then use a different language to derive a class from your original class or call a method on the original class. You can also pass an instance of a class to a method of a class written in a different language. This cross-language integration is possible because language compilers and tools that target the runtime use a common type system defined by the runtime, and they follow the runtime's rules for defining new types, as well as for creating, using, persisting, and binding to types.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime
CMS,Content Management System,"A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS, is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

In simpler language, a content management system is a tool that helps you build a website without needing to write all the code from scratch (or even know how to code at all).

Instead of building your own system for creating web pages, storing images, and other functions, the content management system handles all that basic infrastructure stuff for you so that you can focus on more forward-facing parts of your website.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CMS
CSS,Cascading Style Sheets,"CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.

CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.

",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS
DRY,Don't Repeat Yourself,"Don't repeat yourself (DRY, or sometimes do not repeat yourself) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,[1] replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is stated as ""Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"". The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer.[2] They apply it quite broadly to include ""database schemas, test plans, the build system, even documentation"".[3] When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync. Besides using methods and subroutines in their code, Thomas and Hunt rely on code generators, automatic build systems, and scripting languages to observe the DRY principle across layers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself
HTML,Hyper Text Markup Language,"The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML
HTTP,Hyper Text Transfer Protocol,"The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them. The current version of the HTTP specification is called HTTP/2.

As part of a URI, the ""http"" within ""http://example.com/"" is called a ""scheme"". Resources using the ""http"" schema are typically transported over unencrypted connections using the HTTP protocol. The ""https"" scheme (as in ""https://developer.mozilla.org"") indicates that a resource is transported using the HTTP protocol, but over a secure TLS channel.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP
JAM,JavaScript API Markup,"Jamstack is the new standard architecture for the web. Using Git workflows and modern build tools, pre-rendered content is served to a CDN and made dynamic through APIs and serverless functions. Technologies in the stack include JavaScript frameworks, Static Site Generators, Headless CMSs, and CDNs.",https://jamstack.org/
JS ,JavaScript,"JavaScript (or ""JS"") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the server-side, using a runtime such as Node.js.

JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Although ""Java"" and ""JavaScript"" are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.

JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the DOM, manipulate data with AJAX and IndexedDB, draw graphics with canvas, interact with the device running the browser through various APIs, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of APIs available in browsers.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript
JSON,JavaScript Object Notation,"JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data-interchange format.  Although not a strict subset, JSON closely resembles a subset of JavaScript syntax. Though many programming languages support JSON, JSON is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions.

JSON can represent numbers, booleans, strings, null, arrays (ordered sequences of values), and objects (string-value mappings) made up of these values (or of other arrays and objects).  JSON does not natively represent more complex data types like functions, regular expressions, dates, and so on.  (Date objects by default serialize to a string containing the date in ISO format, so the information isn't completely lost.) If you need JSON to represent additional data types, transform values as they are serialized or before they are deserialized.",https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON
JSX,JavaScript XML,"JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.

JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.",https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_jsx.asp
KISS,Keep It Simple Stupid,"KISS is a term created in the 1960’s which was meant to reflect the approach of creating simple durable aircrafts that could be repaired easily in an emergency. This idea has since been adopted by many branches of science and engineering.

KISS is a term also used in developing solutions to programming problems. Literally translated, KISS means “keep it simple, stupid” or “keep it stupid simple“.
However, it’s assumed, the statement was not supposed to sound negative, rather to suggest

a simple design makes service and maintenance child’s play.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle
LAMP,Linux Apache MySQL PHP,"The widely popular LAMP stack is a set of open source software used for web application development.

For a web application to work smoothly, it has to include an operating system, a web server, a database, and a programming language. The name LAMP is an acronym of the following programs:

Linux Operating System
Apache HTTP Server
MySQL database management system
PHP programming language
Each represents an essential layer of the stack, and together they can create a database-driven and dynamic website.",https://phoenixnap.com/kb/what-is-a-lamp-stack
MAMP,Mac Apache MySQL PHP,"The name MAMP is an acronym that stems from the names of the components of the system:[1] macOS (the operating system); Apache (the web server); MySQL or MariaDB (the database management system); and PHP, Perl, or Python (programming languages used for web development). The name is derived from LAMP, a similar stack of all open-source software widely used for web sites, but substituting the proprietary macOS for the open-source Linux OS. (Similar ""AMP"" stacks exist for other operating systems.) MAMP is not limited to these choices of components, however; Nginx can be used in place of Apache, for example, and the same goes for substituting MariaDB for MySQL.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAMP
MEAN,MongoDB Express Angular Node.js,"MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js)[1] is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.[2]

Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.

Though often compared directly to other popular web development stacks such as the LAMP stack, the components of the MEAN stack are higher-level including a web application presentation layer and not including an operating system layer.[3]

The acronym MEAN was coined by Valeri Karpov.[4] He introduced the term in a 2013 blog post and the logo concept, initially created by Austin Anderson for the original MEAN stack LinkedIn group, is an assembly of the first letter of each component of the MEAN acronym.[5]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)
MERN,MongoDB Express React Node.js,"MERN Stack: MERN Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.
Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.",https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/
MVC,Model View Controller,"MVC is short for Model, View, and Controller. MVC is a popular way of organizing your code. The big idea behind MVC is that each section of your code has a purpose, and those purposes are different. Some of your code holds the data of your app, some of your code makes your app look nice, and some of your code controls how your app functions. Model: Model code typically reflects real-world things. This code can hold raw data, or it will define the essential components of your app. For instance, if you were building a To-do app, the model code would define what a “task” is and what a “list” is – since those are the main components of a todo app. View: View code is made up of all the functions that directly interact with the user. This is the code that makes your app look nice, and otherwise defines how your user sees and interacts with it. Controller: Controller code acts as a liaison between the Model and the View, receiving user input and deciding what to do with it. It’s the brains of the application, and ties together the model and the view.",https://www.codecademy.com/articles/mvc
MVP,Minimum Viable Product,A minimum viable product is a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and unnecessary work.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product
NPM,Node Package Manager,npm is bundled with Node.js. It runs on the command line as the command npm. It is a package manager that downloads packages into a node_modules folder.,https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js
PHP,PHP Hypertext Preprocessor,"PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web development.[5] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.[6] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[7] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[6] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[8]

PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9] and robotic drone control.[10] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP
PIP,PIP Installs Python,"pip is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages. It connects to an online repository of public and paid-for private packages, called the Python Package Index. Most distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)#:~:text=pip%20is%20a%20package%2Dmanagement,Python%20come%20with%20pip%20preinstalled."
REGEX,REGular EXpressions,"A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp;[1] also referred to as rational expression[2][3]) is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for ""find"" or ""find and replace"" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language. The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. Different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax.

Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis. Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries, as it has uses in many situations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression
REPL,Read Eval Print Loop,"A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. The term is usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic Lisp machine interactive environment. Common examples include command line shells and similar environments for programming languages, and the technique is very characteristic of scripting languages.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop
SaaS,Software as a service,"Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)—also known as cloud-based software—is now mainstream. From massive corporations to tiny mom and pop shops, cloud-based software is the default deployment method in 2020 for nearly every type of business technology in the world.

And for good reason. Business applications delivered via a web browser lack painful installations or strict contracts, and are paid for over time instead of all at once. This usually makes the systems more flexible and affordable enough for any budget.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/saas-10-faqs-software-service/
SASS,Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets,"Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster. Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS.",https://sass-lang.com/
SEO,Search Engine Optimisation,Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization
SOAP,Simple Object Access Protocol,"SOAP (formerly an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality, verbosity and independence.[vague] It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

SOAP allows developers to invoke processes running on disparate operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, and Linux) to authenticate, authorize, and communicate using Extensible Markup Language (XML). Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of language and platforms.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP

TDD,Test-Driven Development,"Test-driven development (TDD) is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring. One view is the goal of TDD is specification and not validation. In other words, it’s one way to think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code (implying that TDD is both an important agile requirements and agile design technique). Another view is that TDD is a programming technique. As Ron Jeffries likes to say, the goal of TDD is to write clean code that works.

UI,User Interface,"In the industrial design field of human–computer interaction, a user interface (UI) is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to, or involve such disciplines as, ergonomics and psychology.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface
UX,User eXperience,"UX design is a field of work dedicated to helping a user make their way through a digital process or product with minimal effort and maximum value. Since the UX design field is ever-evolving and relatively new, we might keep coming back to this definition and adjusting it—users, their problems, and how visual developers solve them will change that quickly.",https://webflow.com/blog/what-is-ux-design?gclid=Cj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIaFmheCxY3yO_AYNpVF_OGinLJ4gctMwuK4dxDcpLGwQ-_5U0kDxrkaAoQ7EALw_wcB
XML,eXtensible Markup Language,"XML: XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is also used to create web pages and web applications. It is dynamic because it is used to transport the data not for displaying the data. The design goals of XML focus on simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.",https://www.sitepoint.com/really-good-introduction-xml/
OOD,Object Oriented Programming,"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of ""objects"", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this or self). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include: (list order based on TIOBE index) Java, C++, C#, Python, R, PHP, Visual Basic.NET, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Common Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming

The W3C began work on SVG in the late 1990s, but SVG only became popular when Internet Explorer 9 came out with SVG support. All major browsers now support SVG.

Based on an XML syntax, SVG can be styled with CSS and made interactive using JavaScript. HTML5 now allows direct embedding of SVG tags in an HTML document.

As a vector image format, SVG graphics can scale infinitely, making them invaluable in responsive design, since you can create interface elements and graphics that scale to any screen size. SVG also provides a useful set of tools, such as clipping, masking, filters, and animations.",
